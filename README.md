## The Big Idea

### Items Under Current Development
- Connecting our working backend to the frontend page. This is a connection between the classes that encrypt/hash data, and the page that will log users in. <br>
- Getting a UI in place
- Getting the program to work with more ciphers, such as Bcrypt, aes, and blowfish. Most of these

Algroitms currently implemented:
AES
SHA265
Blowfish
Constant XOR
Dynamic XOR

In development:
Bcyrpt
RSA
